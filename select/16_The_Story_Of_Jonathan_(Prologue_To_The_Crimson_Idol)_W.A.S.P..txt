I was born Jonathan Aron Steele
To the parents of William and Elisabeth Steele
I am a Leo
Born under the sign of the Lion
And I was raised in a lower middle class family
With only one brother - Michael
Whom I loved dearly
He was five years my senior
My father's nickname was Red
Which I could never understand why, because his hair was sandy blonde
Nevertheless, the name stuck
So when my brother was born, my father became Big Red, and my brother Little Red
I should have known from the first time when I realised their special connection, that I just didn't fit into my father's plans
